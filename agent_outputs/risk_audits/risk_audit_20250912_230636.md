## Risk Management Audit Report

### Risk Assessment Score: 7/10

### Critical Risk Issues
- Issue: Orders are placed as separate market + stop + limit orders, which can leave positions unprotected if SL/TP placement fails.
  Impact: Uncapped downside on network/API errors.
  Probability: MEDIUM
  Mitigation: Use bracket/OCO orders where supported so SL/TP are attached atomically to entry orders.

- Issue: Daily trade limit enforced in AdvancedTradingBot but no circuit breaker for daily loss.
  Impact: Potential for compounding losses within trading day.
  Probability: LOW-MEDIUM
  Mitigation: Track realized/unrealized PnL and enforce max_daily_loss_pct from RiskManagementConfig.

### Risk Parameter Validation
- Position Sizing: ✓ Uses max_position_pct and cash reserve; suggest enforcing max_open_positions and sector concentration.
- Stop Losses: ✓ Configured; suggest validating minimum dollar distances for micro-priced assets.
- Daily Limits: ✗ No daily loss circuit breaker implemented in trading bots.
- Cash Management: ✓ min_cash_reserve_pct respected in position sizing functions.

### Edge Case Analysis
- Thinly traded symbols could produce distorted volume_ratio; consider minimum absolute volume filter.
- If account cash is small, position size may round to 0; current code skips trade, which is safe.
- RSI and Bollinger computations default to neutral/identity values on short history; ensure warnings are logged to avoid mis-signals on IPOs.

### Compliance Check
- Pattern Day Trading Rules: Not explicitly enforced; consider restrictions when daytrade_count nears thresholds.
- Margin Requirements: Not modeled; treat buying_power vs. cash usage explicitly depending on account type.
- Position Limits: max_open_positions exists in config but not enforced in bots.

### Stress Test Considerations
- Market Crash Scenario: Ensure stop loss orders use market or stop-market to guarantee execution under gapping conditions; evaluate slippage impact.
- Flash Crash Scenario: Avoid chasing momentum during halts/limit-down; consider market state filters.
- System Failure Scenario: Add emergency flat function to cancel orders and close positions on demand.

### Recommendations
1. Immediate (24h)
   - Implement bracket orders for new entries with attached SL/TP.
   - Enforce max_open_positions and max_daily_loss_pct in both bots.
2. Short-term (1 week)
   - Add sector exposure tracking and per-symbol max_single_stock_pct checks.
   - Add minimum absolute volume and price filters to avoid illiquid/penny stocks.
3. Long-term (1 month)
   - Introduce portfolio-level risk (VaR-like simple measure) and drawdown-based throttling.
   - Add backtesting of risk rules and publish risk dashboards.
