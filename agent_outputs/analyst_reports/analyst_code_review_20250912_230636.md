## Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)
- File: api_schemas.py
  Issue: Inconsistent consumer expectations for validation return types; downstream code/tests expect both attribute (model.id) and dict-style (model['id']) access. Also, earlier file corruption led to missing/duplicated definitions and unclear error messages for missing fields.
  Risk Level: HIGH
  Recommendation: Standardize validation return type via a lightweight wrapper that supports both attribute and item access, and preserve legacy error messaging for required fields. Implemented _ModelAccessor and explicit id pre-check in validate_account_schema.

- File: alpaca_config.py
  Issue: Missing get_effective_mode utility and incorrect validate_credentials implementation (returned early and validated wrong env var names). get_client depended on globals set only for one mode.
  Risk Level: HIGH
  Recommendation: Implement get_effective_mode defaulting to PAPER. Rework get_client to load env on demand and read correct variables (ALPACA_PAPER_API_KEY/SECRET, ALPACA_LIVE_API_KEY/SECRET). Fix validate_credentials to check proper variables and raise on missing. Implemented.

### Code Quality Score: 7.5/10

### Performance Issues
- Simple rate limiter in AlpacaTradingClient lacks jitter/backoff on 429s. Consider exponential backoff with randomness to avoid thundering herd.
- Technical indicator calculations are straightforward and fine for current scale; if watchlists grow, consider vectorization/caching of SMA/RSI across symbols.

### Security Concerns
- Good: logging_config sanitizes secrets thoroughly. Ensure all modules exclusively use these loggers for API error logging. AlpacaTradingClient currently logs error messages directly; consider routing through safe_api_error_log.
- Ensure .env and logs are excluded from VCS and production backups. Confirm permissions on logs/ directory in deployment.

### Recommendations
- Standardize order risk management using OCO/bracket orders where supported to ensure atomic SL/TP placement with entries.
- Centralize schema validation usage inside AlpacaTradingClient (e.g., validate_api_response) right after HTTP calls to fail fast and return typed models.
- Add proper validation helpers in trading_strategies_config (validate_risk_config, validate_momentum_config, etc.) or deprecate those in favor of config_schemas models; update tests accordingly.
- Implement a unified error type hierarchy (e.g., TradingError, ApiRateLimitError) for clearer upstream handling.
- Add retries with backoff for transient network errors in _make_request; cap total attempts and propagate context.
- Extend unit tests to cover order placement boundaries and stop/take-profit calculations, including rounding rules and fractional shares where applicable.
- Add type hints to all public functions and enable mypy in CI.

## Notable Improvements Made In This Review
- Implemented get_effective_mode(), fixed validate_credentials(), and refactored get_client() to read credentials safely from environment.
- Restored api_schemas correctness and backward-compatible behavior via _ModelAccessor and legacy error message for missing id.
- Verified core component tests now pass (test_core_components.py).

---

## Suggested Next Steps
- Integrate schema validation into AlpacaTradingClient responses (account, positions, orders, bars) via api_schemas.validate_api_response.
- Add missing validation helpers in trading_strategies_config or remove associated legacy tests if superseded by config_schemas.
- Add a simple retry/backoff utility and apply in _make_request on 429 and 5xx with sanitized logging.
- Create integration tests that mock Alpaca endpoints to ensure order workflows (including SL/TP) behave as expected without live API calls.
- Add CI configuration to run unittest/pytest and generate coverage.
